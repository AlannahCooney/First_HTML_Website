                <h3>Advantages Of HTML:</h3>
                <p>1: For Simple edits, it is often faster to make changes to a page using a text editor.</p>
                <p>2: Text editors teach you how to read HTML. They often have wizards and functions to do more common tasks, but you'll learn HTML and basic coding if you use a text editor.</p>
                <p>3: A web developer who can write HTML using a text editor will be more marketable than one who can only use a WYSIWYG editor. The former is more flexible and can get up to speed on any HTML editing tool, while the latter has to start all over with each new editing tool.</p>
                <p>4: The only HTML that will be in the document will be tags that you placed there deliberately. This will help your pages download faster, as well as look leaner.</p>
                <p>5: The HTML can be spaced as your team likes it, and include commenets or other notes to allow more efficient editing by other team members.</p>

                <h3>Disadvantages of HTML:</h3>
                <p>1: While most HTML text editors can help with tags and suggest attributes and so on, these helpers are no subsitute for knowing HTML. Most modern text editors offer drag-and-drop styles such as bold and italic, but, if you can't remeber the code for "non-breaking space" your editor might not be able to help.</p>
                <p>2: Because you have to learn both HTML and the editor functions itself, a beginner will find a text editor more difficult to use. .</p>
                <p>3: Some people find text editors more difficult to design pages in because they can't visualize how the page will look just from the HTML.</p>
                <P>4: HTML editors often create an excessive code that makes the web page bulky in size. This leads to a slower download of the page which is uncomfortable and tiring for users.</P>
                <P>5: Some editors allow using "Browser specific HTML tags" that are suitable for specific browsers and ignored by the rest.</P>
